# Landing project

I made this project not really for a specific topic but I wanted the theme to be "nature". I was more concentrated on working my css skills, researched some tings to manipulate them a certain way. I can say im very happy with the outcome. 

Warning: project may become addictive!!

p.s. I appreciate any feedback, it would honestly be nice lol.
